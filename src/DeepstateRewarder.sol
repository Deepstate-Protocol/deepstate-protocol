/// @title Deepstate Rewarder
/// @notice Minimal reward accounting contract for canonical top buyers.
/// @dev
/// The matching engine calls `execute` when a rewarded token's top buyer changes or its live
/// amount changes. This contract accrues `amount * duration` to the outgoing order nonce, then
/// resets the pool-scoped cursor to the incoming nonce. Balances remain book-scoped because nonces
/// are unique only inside a book.
///
/// The rewarder does not decide whether an order is top of book. That decision stays inside the
/// matching engine, which has the radix tree context. The rewarder only receives a hook with:
/// pool id, book id, rewarded token, outgoing top amount, and incoming top nonce.
///
/// `token` is the token whose buyer is being rewarded, not necessarily the ERC20 paid as rewards.
/// For token0 rewards the top buyer is the best bid. For token1 rewards the top buyer is the best
/// ask, measured by the ask's live base amount because rewards are relative to the token being
/// bought in that side's accounting.
